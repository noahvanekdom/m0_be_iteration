# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?  

**I actually feel way better following this and the coding challenge from the conditionals exercise. Feeling pretty good about it now**

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

**I had some unproductive struggle trying to take on the medium coding challenge without really understanding what tools I even needed to approach it. Doing my pairing session with Thomas helped significantly, I feel much more comfortable asking questions over zoom, and need to improve my comfort asking questions over slack/in text format.**

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

**Similar to my comment after the conditionals practice, I just need to keep practicing, which I've definitely built time for.**

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?


**I definitely need to sleep on this question in all honesty.**
